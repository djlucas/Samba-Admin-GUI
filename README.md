This is initial code written entirly by Gemini. It was basically just intended to be a test, but figured I'd put it to work on something I might actually want to use at some point. Admittedly, I was pleasantly surprised. Now, don't get me wrong, I've had to correct every single step, but the amount of manual typing I've done is baiscally nil. It's a fun experiment, and I figured it a good way to learn PyQT while I'm at it.

Right now, only saduc exists, and is entirely read only and largely incomplete. If DNS and your kdc.conf file are setup correctly, it'll propt you for login, kinit for you, and read the tree and that's about it for right now, and even that is using subprocess() for the kerberos funcitons...and will continue to do so until I bother to actually write a kerberos python module that can properly klist and kdestroy. A few things are stubbed out to get an idea of how to go about the UI, but mostly just stubbed at this point.

I'll update this readme when it is eventually useful. I intend to add the sdns, ssas (presumably with a built-in method to actauly do sysvol syncs for samba DCs), and sgpoe. If you can put any of this to use, feel free to do so. I of course appreciate any pull requests, PRs, whatever you can contribute.
